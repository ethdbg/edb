# EDB

Not built around 'Just a Hook'. This debugger is built directly onto a customized VM, and has all of it's tools at its disposal. We make the hooks.

This Debugger plans to be unopinionated and general. As first, however, it will mainly support the Ethereum Main chain and the Solidity/Vyper languages.


Two Debug Types:
- Testnet Debug (Debug Deploy, Contract Functionality, within the context of all other Ethereum State on Parity Testnet) (WIP)
- EVM Debug (Debug only within the context of the EVM, does not interact with overall Ethereum State)


### Supported Languages
- [] Solidity
- [] Vyper
- [] Serpent
- [] LLL

### Supported Chains
- [] Ethereum Main
- [] Ethereum Classic
- [] Ellaism
- [] Ubiq
- [] Expanse
- [] Musicoin

# EDB

Not built around 'Just a Hook'. This debugger is built directly into the parity client, and has all of it's tools at its disposal. We make the hooks.


Two Debug Types:
- Testnet Debug (Debug Deploy, Contract Functionality, within the context of all other Ethereum State on Parity Testnet) (WIP)
- EVM Debug (Debug only within the context of the EVM, does not interact with overall Ethereum State)

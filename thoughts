so here's what i can do

I can create a whole testrpc implementation on top of parity basically

or we just have a small wrapper over the evm and we create JUST a debugger
  - possibly this can work with a testRPC
  - how?
    - making it work with TestRPC too complicated possibly
      - have to deal with multiple threads
  - IMO, out of scope of this project. not needed.
    - just stick to designing a debugger around the parity EVM
      - no need to mix in testRPC in it

  - need testRPC for augur bounty, need it for this
    - will make dev easier b/c anotehr testrpc not needed
      - can have op to get rid of testrpc
  - need to write testrpc seperately though
    - rpc methods in parity:
      - run.rs line 804: RPC client setup
      - rpc methods use client for executing transactions
        - uses client.rs in ethcore
      - client.rs uses Executive
      - we have executive
      - so would probably need to rewrite everything above executive for own rpc xD
